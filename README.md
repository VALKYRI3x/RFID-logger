# 🔐 Smart RFID-Based Access Control System

A **contactless access control system** built with **ESP8266 NodeMCU**, **RC522 RFID reader**, **16x2 LCD**, and **buzzer**.  
The project demonstrates how RFID technology combined with IoT-ready microcontrollers can provide **secure, scalable, and cost-effective authentication** for modern environments.

---

## ✨ Features
- RFID-based **authentication** using RC522 module & unique tag UIDs  
- **LCD feedback** → `Access Granted` / `Access Denied`  
- **Buzzer alerts** for instant audio feedback  
- **IoT-ready design** with ESP8266 Wi-Fi capability (future cloud integration possible)  
- **Modular and affordable** → built with widely available components

## 🛠 Components Used
- ESP8266 NodeMCU  
- RC522 RFID Reader Module  
- RFID Cards/Tags  
- 16x2 LCD Display (with I2C adapter)  
- Buzzer  
- Breadboard, jumper wires, USB 5V power supply

## ⚡ How It Works
1. Power on the system (5V USB supply).  
2. LCD prompts → `Scan RFID Card`.  
3. Place RFID tag near RC522 reader.  
   - If UID matches → LCD shows `Access Granted`, buzzer beeps once.  
   - If UID not found → LCD shows `Access Denied`, buzzer long beep.  
4. Optional: UID logging or cloud integration for future scalability.

## 📦 Installation & Usage
1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  
2. Add **ESP8266 board package** in Arduino IDE.  
3. Install required libraries:  
   - `MFRC522` (for RFID)  
   - `LiquidCrystal_I2C` (for LCD)  
   - `SPI`, `Wire` (included by default)  
4. Connect the hardware as per circuit diagram.  
5. Upload the provided code (`rfid_access_control.ino`) to ESP8266 NodeMCU.  
6. Edit the code to add your **authorized UIDs** in the `authorizedUIDs[]` array.
